# Complementary repository: Final discrete-event simulation models and streamlit applications from Large Language Models

This repository is complementary to:

> Thomas Monks, Alison Harper, Amy Heather, and Navonil Mustafee. **Using Large Language Models to support researchers reproduce and reuse unpublished health care discrete-event simulation computer models: a feasibility and pilot study in Python**. https://github.com/pythonhealthdatascience/llm_simpy.

It contains the final formatted code from each of the SimPy discrete-event simulation models that were generated by Perplexity as part of that project. The web apps are deployed as a single app on Streamlit Community Cloud.

**Link to the deployed app:** <!--TODO: Add link-->

**Code:** The final formatted code from each stage are stored in 📁`llm_code\`:

* `ccu_stage1.py`: Critical care unit model from Stage 1.
* `ccu_stage2.py`: Critical care unit model from Stage 2.
* `stroke_model_stage1.py` and `stroke_app_stage1.py`:  Stroke model from Stage 1.
* `stroke_model_stage2.py` and `stroke_app_stage2.py`: Stroke model from Stage 2.

For a full record of the generation of these models, please refer to: https://github.com/pythonhealthdatascience/llm_simpy.

## 🌐 Creating the environment

The project uses `conda` to manage dependencies. Navigate your terminal to the directory containing the code and run:

```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

This will create a conda environment called `gen_simpy`. To activate:

```
conda activate gen_simpy
```

## 🖥️ Viewing the apps locally

For deployment, we have brought the LLM-generated apps together into a single app, which can be deployed by running:

```
streamlit run Home.py
```

However, you can also run the individual original apps generated by the LLMs by calling on a specific file - for example:

```
streamlit run llm_code/ccu_formatted_code_stage2.py
```
