# Complementary repository: Final discrete-event simulation models and streamlit applications from Large Language Models

This repository is complementary to:

> Thomas Monks, Alison Harper, Amy Heather, and Navonil Mustafee. **Using Large Language Models to support researchers reproduce and reuse unpublished health care discrete-event simulation computer models: a feasibility and pilot study in Python**. https://github.com/pythonhealthdatascience/llm_simpy.

It contains the final formatted code from each of the SimPy discrete-event simulation models that were generated by Perplexity as part of that project. The web apps are deployed as a single app on Streamlit Community Cloud.

**Link to the deployed app:** <!--TODO: Add link-->

**Code:** The final formatted code from each stage are stored in üìÅ`llm_code\`:

* `ccu_formatted_code.py`: Critical care unit model from Stage 1.
* `ccu_formatted_code_stage2.py`: Critical care unit model from Stage 2.
* `stroke_rehab_model.py`:  Stroke model from Stage 1.
* `stroke_rehabe_model.py`: Stroke model from Stage 2.

For a full record of the generation of these models, please refer to: https://github.com/pythonhealthdatascience/llm_simpy.

## üåê Creating the environment

The project uses `conda` to manage dependencies. Navigate your terminal to the directory containing the code and run:

```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

This will create a conda environment called `gen_simpy`. To activate:

```
conda activate gen_simpy
```
